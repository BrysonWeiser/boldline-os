# BoldLine OS — Integrations & Setup Log

Detailed record of external-platform setup.

> **No secret values are stored here** — only variable names, non-secret account
> identifiers, decisions, and state. All credential values live only in Netlify
> environment variables.

Last updated: **2026-06-25**

## Netlify environment variables
All app secrets live here. Convention: ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE, marked **"Contains
secret values"**, same value across Production / Deploy Previews / Branch deploys /
Preview Server & Agent Runners (Local development is dropped automatically for
secret vars — we don't use the Netlify CLI locally, so this is fine).

Pre-existing vars: `OWNER_EMAIL`, `OWNER_PHONE`, `REPORTS_FROM_EMAIL`,
`RESEND_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`,
`TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER`, `URL`.

## DocuSign (e-signature) — credentials DONE ✅ · code built ✅ · LIVE-VERIFIED ✅ (demo)
- **Live-verified 2026-06-25:** test envelope sent from the Deploy-tab "Test DocuSign
  Connection" card → email delivered → signing document opened successfully. Full JWT
  round-trip (sign → token → envelope → deliver) confirmed working end to end.
- **Environment: DEMO / sandbox** (`demo.docusign.net` REST base + `account-d.docusign.com` auth server).
  - ⚠️ **Demo signatures are NOT legally binding** (watermarked). Before the first
    real client: open a **production** DocuSign account, complete the **Go-Live
    promotion** (requires ~20 successful API calls in demo first — every test send we
    make now counts toward that 20), and regenerate ALL DocuSign credentials for
    production. Known future work, deferred until a real client is close.
- Auth method: **JWT Grant** (server-to-server, unattended). One-time consent grant
  **COMPLETED 2026-06-25** (redirect landed cleanly with `?code=...`).
- Account: BoldLine Media, account #48872018. Integration type: **Private custom
  integration** (locks once Go-Live passes "Ready to Submit" — chosen deliberately).
- RSA keypair generated (public key auto-registered with DocuSign; private key
  saved to Netlify only). Placeholder redirect URI `https://www.docusign.com`
  registered — required for the consent flow, otherwise unused.
- Env vars: `DOCUSIGN_INTEGRATION_KEY`, `DOCUSIGN_USER_ID`, `DOCUSIGN_ACCOUNT_ID`,
  `DOCUSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY`, `DOCUSIGN_BASE_PATH` (DocuSign demo/sandbox REST base — value in Netlify).
- **Code:** `netlify/functions/docusign-send.mjs` — JWT Grant auth + envelope send,
  secured by the owner's Supabase session. Front end wired in two places: "Send via
  DocuSign" on a client's Contract tab (sends the rendered service agreement, marks
  contract "pending", stores `docusignEnvelopeId`), and a "Test DocuSign Connection"
  card on the Deploy tab (sends a non-binding test envelope to any email — self-serve
  credential verification). Signature tab placed on an invisible `/BL_SIGN_HERE/`
  anchor in the contract.
- **GOTCHA — the private-key paste (cost ~3 retries before it worked):**
  `DOCUSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY` kept failing at the `sign` stage. Cause: pasting a multi-line
  PEM key into Netlify's secret field collapses the internal newlines, and Node's
  `crypto` then rejects the malformed PEM. Fix in code: `normalizeKey()` now rebuilds
  canonical PEM (re-wraps the base64 body at 64 chars) whenever the BEGIN/END markers
  survived, so a flattened paste self-heals; the `sign`-stage error also returns
  non-secret structural facts (length, line count, marker presence) for diagnosis.
  **When we regenerate the key for production we'll likely hit the same paste issue —
  the code tolerates it now, but cleanest is to keep the newlines intact on paste.**
- **TODO (later, not blocking):** (1) envelope status sync (webhook/poll) so a signed
  contract auto-flips status to "active" instead of staying "pending"; (2) optional:
  exercise the real "Send via DocuSign" on a test client's Contract tab (same verified
  backend — only the contract-HTML rendering path is untested); (3) production
  promotion before first real client (see warning above).

## Google Ads API — credentials DONE ✅ · code built ✅ · awaiting Basic Access + first client ⏳
- Architecture: one **MCC** manager account (ID in Netlify) + one Developer Token +
  one OAuth refresh token operate across all linked client accounts via the
  `login-customer-id` header.
- Google Cloud project created, Google Ads API enabled. OAuth consent screen
  **published to PRODUCTION** (avoids the 7-day refresh-token expiry of Testing mode).
- Two OAuth clients exist: a **Desktop-app** one (unused — OAuth Playground rejected
  it with `redirect_uri_mismatch`) and a **Web-application** one (the one in use; has
  `https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground` as an authorized redirect URI).
  The refresh token was generated via OAuth Playground against the Web-app client, so
  the `CLIENT_ID`/`CLIENT_SECRET` in Netlify must be the **Web-app** client's.
  (Refresh tokens are bound to the client that issued them.)
- Developer Token: currently **Explorer Access** (test accounts only). **Basic Access
  application submitted 2026-06-25** (~3 business-day review). The application
  included a custom design doc that cited the Task #8 approval-queue as the
  human-in-the-loop safety story.
- Env vars: `GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN`, `GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID`,
  `GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_ADS_REFRESH_TOKEN`,
  `GOOGLE_ADS_MANAGER_CUSTOMER_ID` (stored WITH dashes; the code strips them when
  calling the API). Optional: `GOOGLE_ADS_API_VERSION` — see caveat below.
- **Code (built 2026-06-25, pending live-verify):** `netlify/functions/google-ads.mjs`
  — OAuth refresh-token → access-token exchange, then actions: `test`
  (listAccessibleCustomers — the smoke test), `campaigns` (GAQL read: campaigns +
  30-day metrics), `setBudget` + `setStatus` (guarded writes). Secured by the owner's
  Supabase session, same as DocuSign. Front end: a "Test Google Ads Connection" card
  on the Deploy tab (one-click connectivity check, mirrors the DocuSign test card).
  New client field `googleAdsCustomerId` added to the data model for per-client
  linking (Task #17). Built but **staged on the feature branch, NOT merged to main** —
  it can't be live-verified until Basic Access is granted, and a failing test card on
  the live OS would just confuse. Merge + verify together once the token lands.
  - ⚠️ **API version caveat:** `API_VERSION` defaults to `v18` in the code. Google
    sunsets versions ~yearly; this is the value most likely to be stale at test time.
    If the `test` call errors with "version not found / deprecated", set
    `GOOGLE_ADS_API_VERSION` in Netlify to a current version — no code change needed.
- **Approve→execute wiring is deferred (correctly):** ARIA's `propose_action` logs a
  *descriptive* proposal (title/detail/category) to the approval queue; `decideAction`
  records the approve/reject. Turning an approval into a real `setBudget`/`setStatus`
  call needs live campaign reads first (to resolve the specific campaign + resource
  names), so it's a post-Basic-Access task. The executable pieces are ready in
  `google-ads.mjs`; only the final UI wire-up remains.
- **TODO:** Basic Access approval (Task #16) → live-verify via the test card + bump
  API version if needed → link first client account to the MCC (Task #17) → wire
  approve→execute.

## Stripe (BoldLine service-fee billing) — NOT started ⏳
- Purpose: bill clients **BoldLine's management/service fee only**. NOT ad spend —
  the client pays Google/Meta directly (see hard business constraint in CLAUDE.md).
- Research/walkthrough already given in chat. Task #10.

## Meta Marketing API — NOT started ⏳
- **Longest approval pipeline** of all four (Business Verification + app review —
  can take weeks). Worth starting EARLY so the clock runs in the background. Task #12.

## Reference: existing OS safety capability
- **Task #8** built a human-in-the-loop guardrail: `propose_action` → `pendingActions`
  queue → Approve/Reject. No automated process executes a real ad-account change
  without manual approval. Reused as the safety story in the Google Ads Basic Access
  design doc, and the model for how all "guarded autonomy" should work.

---

## Deferred (do not start until OS automation is done)
- **Task #18:** rebuild BoldLine Media's own website (custom-built, Netlify-hosted,
  domain `boldlinemedia.com` DNS repointed from Wix — no Wix Premium / no registrar
  transfer needed) **+** add an AI website-builder feature into the OS itself
  (extending the existing AI landing-page generator). Bryson may later sell full
  website builds as a service. Explicitly deferred until Tasks #9–17 are done.
